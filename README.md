# CSSMultiTool

## About Project

Let's face it - nobody has time for remembering all properties for CSS box-shadow. 
I also got tired with googling all necessary information. So I decided to create tool that would help me
and fellow developers to deal with that problem.

## Features

With CSSMultiTool it's easy to manage settings of border, border-radius, box-shadow, text-shadow and all fonts
CSS properties - and more to come!.
